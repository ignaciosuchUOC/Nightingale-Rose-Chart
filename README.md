# Nightingale-Rose-Chart
This repository is merely to show how to make a Nightingale Rose Chart in Python.
For this purpose, we will use a csv obtained from the National Institute of Statistics in Spain where it reflects
the cases and deaths registered due to SARS-COVID-2 in the year 2021. 

Inside the csv, there are 3 variables: 
  - Month: Indicates the number of the month of the data registered (1: January, 2:February, ...) **int value**
  - Cases: Indicates the number of people who were infected by SARS-COVID-2 that month. **int value**
  - Deaths: Indicates those people who were infected and who died by SARS-COVID-2 that month. **int value**
